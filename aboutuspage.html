    <br>
  'I have been head of fundraising for Care for Climate for around 5 years and I am truly honored to be around people that are constanly pushing for more to be done to help our planet. I have seen first hand what we do and the positive impacts it has on the environment and the community. I am very optimistic about our charity contribution to the future as we continue to grow and thrive. I was around in the beginning when we only had 10 members now we have thousands of people a week that donate and volunteer on a regular basis. I am so proud of what this fmaily has grown in to and I hope you join us as we continue to make the world a better place with a more bright future. '

  <br>
'I run the operations of the company on a daily basis by making decisons on where are resouces should be assigned. The most challenging part of my job is having to pick between too important projects. For example, perhaps we have the funding to either run a campaign for taxing on high emisson of C02 businesses or purchasing more land that would have been subject to deforestation and planting more trees. Due to this I greatly encourage people to volunteer and donate so we can take on more incredible projects. Despite its challenges working for this charity is extremely rewarding, for anyone that thinks there is nothing they can do as an individual to help the climate change, this charity proves that to be false. Although we run lots of big communities projects we also see the difference made my those people who go above and beyond by recycling and reducing their C02 emissions. I promise you if everyone tries harder it adds up!'
