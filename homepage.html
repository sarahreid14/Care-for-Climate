    <h2>An environmental charity working to a brighter future</h2>

   <div class="d-flex align-items-end bg-light mb-3" style="height: 600px;">
    <div class="col">We are a charity that works to help our planet and the people and animals who love on it before it is too late. Our goal is to stablise the increasing temperature of the planet by reducing our C02 levels to below the carbon neutral level.
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="temperature graph.png">
      <br>
        As you can see from the graph there has been a sharp increase in temperature over the last 200 years this is due to many factors:
      <ul>
        <li>Increase in population</li>
        <li>Industrial revolutions in many countries</li>
        <li>Increased standard of living</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col"> 
      <br>
      <p1><strong>  'We are living on the planet like we have another one to go to'</p1></strong>
      <br>
      Every year we are taking a step towards irreversible damage to our home planet. A common misconception is that we will always have time to change and that it is someone else's problem. This is wrong and irresponsible. The harsh reality is that every increase in CO2 causes a slight increase in the temperature causes some of the icebergs to melt. This is not just bad for the polar bears it is bad for you as well; icebergs contain methane which will further cause the increase in temperature.

     <div class="col"><strong><h3>How you can get involved</h3></strong>
     <br>
     <ul>
       <li>We have many local projects that you can get involved in from meetings on reducing emissions and electricuty consumption to how to recycle</li>
       <li>You could join our team, we are always looking for driven and passionate members to join our team, there is plenty of roles avaliable to suit a wide range of abilites and skills</li>
       <li>If you're a rather busy person but still would like to help, subscribing to a monthly donation would greatly benefit the charity as we need both volunteers and mney to keep the charity running at such a high level </li>
       <li> For those looking for an adventure we also participate in huge international climate conventions where we need volunteers to help with the organisation and logistics of it, previous meetings have been in Tokyo and New York.</li>
      </ul>
